Try this:

1. Determine how long the key is. This is done by XORing the encrypted
data with itself shifted various numbers of places, and examining how
many bytes are the same.

2. If the bytes that are equal are greater than a certain percentage (6%
accoridng to Bruce Schneier's Applied Cryptography second edition), then
you have shifted the data by a multiple of the keylength. By finding the
smallest amount of shifting that results in a large amount of equal
bytes, you find the keylength.

3. Shift the cipher text by the keylength, and XOR against itself. This
removes the key and leaves you with the plaintext XORed with the
plaintext shifted the length of the key. There should be enough
plaintext to determine the message content.
